# PyBank
I created a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a hypothetical company. I was given two sets of revenue data. Each dataset composed of two columns: Date and Revenue.

It calculates each of the following:
- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The total amount of revenue gained over the entire period
- The average change in revenue between months over the entire period
- The greatest increase in revenue (date and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in revenue (date and amount) over the entire period

# PyBoss
Hypothetically, I am the boss. I oversee hundreds of employees across the country developing Tuna 2.0, a world-changing snack food based on canned tuna fish. Alas, being the boss isn't all fun, games, and self-adulation. The company recently decided to purchase a new HR system, and unfortunately for me, the new system requires employee records be stored completely differently.

My task was to help bridge the gap by creating a Python script able to convert my employee records to the required format:
- The Name column should be split into separate First Name and Last Name columns.
- The DOB data should be re-written into DD/MM/YYYY format.
- The SSN data should be re-written such that the first five numbers are hidden from view.
- The State data should be re-written as simple two-letter abbreviations.
